**YouTube Sentiment Analysis**

This project explores the relationship between YouTube comment sentiment and engagement metrics like the like/dislike ratio. The goal is to understand how viewers actually feel about videos by analyzing their comments and comparing them to how they interact through likes and dislikes.

We started by labeling sentiment using a basic tool called TextBlob, which looks for positive or negative words. Later, we trained a custom machine learning model to better capture the tone of comments using real patterns in the text. The project includes data exploration, visualizations, and comparisons between sentiment and viewer engagement.

**üìÅ Project Structure**

- `notebooks/` ‚Äì Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks showing analysis, sentiment labeling, and modeling.
- `datasets/` ‚Äì Contains the full YouTube dataset (`USvideos.csv`, `UScomments.csv`). These files are too large to preview on GitHub, but they load fine locally.
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äì List of Python packages used in the project.
